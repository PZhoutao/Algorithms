### Count Inversions
Given a list of distinct numbers x1, x2,..., xn, xi and xj is an inversion if 
i \< j and xi \> xj. This program is to compute the total number of inversions 
in a list from a divide and conquer way.

To see the result, run the following command:
```
cat IntegerArray.txt | python CountInverse.py
```
