## Greedy Algorithm

### 1. Job Schedule
A list of jobs is provided. Each job has its weight and time length. 
Jobs must be done one by one.

cost of each job = weight*(finish time)

Greedy algorithm is used to find the order of jobs which minimizes the total cost.

### 2. Prim's minimium spanning tree algorithm
This program runs Prim's minimium spanning tree algorithm on a graph containing 
negative edge weight. A heap is used to find the edge with minimum cost among the 
edges that connect explored and unexplored vertices at each iteration.
