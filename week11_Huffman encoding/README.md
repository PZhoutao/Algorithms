## Huffman Encoding
You can compress a text file by running:
```
python HuffmanComp.py yourtxtfile
```
A ".bin" file and ".tree" file will be created. To decompress, run the 
following code:
```
python HuffmanDecomp.py binfilename
```

## Introduction to Dynamic Programming
### Maximum-weight independent set of a path graph
Given a path graph, use dynamic programming to find the subset of 
vertices in which no pair of vertices are adjacent and the sum of of the 
weights of vertices is maximized.
